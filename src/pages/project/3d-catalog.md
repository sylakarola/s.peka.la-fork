Lego® Brand Catalog is a physical magazine that goes out twice a year and
presents all LEGO® sets currently available on market. LEGO® 3D Catalog is an app where you can view
LEGO® products as animations and explore them from all sides.

## The Brief and the Debrief

For a long time, LEGO® 3D Catalog it was an app where the pdf version of the catalog lived. Besides the pdf, users were able to explore some of the set animations in 3D. The company wanted to refresh the app and turned to the engineering team for helped. I joined the team to lead the design process. The business request was to refresh it and make it
more engaging. One of my first and biggest challenges was to understand who
the app was for. I knew it was used internally and in retail stores, but the
business wanted to make sure it reaches out to a broader audience. Having
investigated the functionality of the app and aligning it with existing user
groups of the company, I decided to make the first iteration suitable for
children. I chose the target group of users aged 4-12 who are curious and liked experimenting and exploring. We
managed to persuade the business we had to follow our audience guidelines and
legal requirements and had stick to only one user group. This was a long process
that took several meetings with the business and the legal team before we went
out to play and learn with our chosen target audience.

## User Tests

At the time we had a biweekly test set up with children aged 6-12 in two schools
in the area. I used that opportunity to show the first prototype to children and
learn. Before going out to explore the potential of the app, I had several days
for creating a map of existing features and possibilities. I made a simple
prototype based on the assumptions coming from our target audience research
from previous years. I discussed it with the engineers on the team. I decided
not to test the existing app design as it was made to fit adults, not children.
The testing areas were:
- UI interactions
- reading and symbol understanding
- interactions with animations and
- the use of wishlist in real life. 

The engineering lead was present in most of the tests and the rest of
the team had access to test recordings and notes.

The results of the first test showed us that we had to make a lot of changes and
aim for the app to be as simple as possible.

## The Nature of Lists — Learnings

After several rounds of tests, we created a set of base rules. The app’s primary
functionality was to watch animations. The user could use the app regardless of if they
had a physical catalog. The secondary feature was a wishlist. It came from a request
from the business. It had been a hot topic in all our internal projects, so we
used the opportunity to gather learnings on how children would use it. The
wishlist was a separate topic area. In between tests I did an extensive desk
research on wishlists and list for children in general. I decided to abandon the
concept of organized list. We also learned children didn’t fully understand the
concept of a wishlist if it wasn’t around their birthday or Christmas time. We
changed the wishlist to “favorite products” list instead. The test showed
children like the interactive nature of it. They were able to move around
bubbles with products, play back favorite animations, remove an item by either
pressing trash can symbol or dragging an object over. Even though they were children, we still allowed them freedom of choice.

**After several rounds of tests, we created a set of base rules.**

- The app’s primary functionality was to watch animations.
- The user could use the app whether or no they had a physical catalog.
- We provided a favorite list and used it to gather info on wishlists. 

 On top of that I also
performed several tests on the understanding of symbols that were used for the
app.

## From Sketch to Unity to marketing

Having designed an easy to use and simple app, that was also approved by the
business, we moved to building it. The engineering team started working on implementing the desing. I worked closely on the interactions with two of engineers and kept on testing with children. 

Apart from the UI design, I was asked to
design the icon and a promo material. The latter included a page in the
catalogue inviting to download the app and presenting its purpose. We also added
the app icon on each page as the test showed some children didn’t browse the
catalogue but opened it on their favorite theme and didn’t explore further.

The first version of the app had close to no tracking attached, so we
started fresh with analytics in the new version and took learnings from there.
What stroke us the most was that the decision of looping and auto playing
animations lead to nearly 20 minutes spend on the app per session.
