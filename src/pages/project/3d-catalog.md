Lego® Brand Catalog is a physical magazine that goes out twice a year and
presents all available LEGO sets. LEGO 3D Catalog is an app where you can view
LEGO products as animations and explore them from all sides.

## The Brief and the Debrief

For a long time there was an app where the pdf version of the catalog lived. On
top of that users could see some of the set animations in 3D. The company wanted
to refresh the app and turned to the engineering team that I joined to find out
what changes we should make. The business request was to refresh it and make it
more engaging. One of my biggest challenges with the app was to understand who
the app was for. I knew it was used internally and in retail stores, but the
business wanted to make sure it reaches out to a broader audience. Having
investigated the functionality of the app and aligned it with existing user
groups of the company I decided to make the first iteration suitable for
children aged 4-12 who are curious and like experimenting and exploring. We
managed to persuade the business that according to our audience guidelines and
legal requirements we had stick to only one user group. This was a long process
that took several meetings with the business and the legal team before we went
out to play and learn with our target audience.

## User Tests

At the time we had biweekly test set up with children aged 6-12 in two schools
in the area. I used that opportunity to show the first prototype to children and
learn. Before going out to explore the potential of the app, I had several days
for creating a map of existing features and possibilities. I made a simple
prototype based on the assumptions coming from our target audience research
during previous years. I discussed it with the engineers on the team. I decided
not to test the existing app design as it was made to fit adults, not children.
The testing areas were 1) UI interactions, 2) reading and symbol
understanding, 3) interactions with animations and 4) the use of wishlist in
real life. The engineering lead was present in most of the tests and the rest of
the team had access to test recordings and notes.

The results of the first test showed us that we had to make a lot of changes and
aim for the app to be as simple as possible.

## The Nature of Lists — Learnings

After several rounds of tests, we created a set of base rules. The app’s primary
functionality was to watch animations. The user could use the app whether they
had a physical catalog. The secondary feature was a wishlist that was requested
from the business but had been a hot topic in all our internal projects, so we
used the opportunity to gather learnings on how children would use it. The
wishlist was a separate topic actually. In between test I did an extensive desk
research on wishlists and list for children in general. I decided to abandon the
concept of organized list. We also learned children didn’t fully understand the
concept of a wishlist if it wasn’t around their birthday or Christmas time. We
changed the wishlist to “favorite products” list instead. The test showed
children like the interactive nature of it. They were able to move around
bubbles with products, play back favorite animations, remove an item by either
pressing trash can symbol or dragging an object over.

performed several tests on the understanding of symbols that were used for the
app.

## From Sketch to Unity

Having designed an easy to use and simple app, that was also approved by the
business, we moved to building it. Apart from the UI design, I was asked to
design the icon and a promo material. The latter included a page in the
catalogue inviting to download the app and presenting its purpose. We also added
the app icon on each page as the test showed some children didn’t browse the
catalogue but opened it on their favorite theme and didn’t explore further.

The first version of the app didn’t have almost any tracking attached, so we
started fresh with analytics in the new version and took learnings from there.
What stroke the most was that the decision of looping and auto playing
animations lead to nearly 20 minutes spend on the app per session.
