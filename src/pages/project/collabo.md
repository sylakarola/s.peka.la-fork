Collabo (earlier Bundl) was a small startup that I joined in 2016. It
was a visual collaboration platform for apparel and lifestyle brands and their
suppliers. The SaaS platform covered the whole product cycle: from the design to
a finished product arrival at the company.

## User Interface

I joined Collabo as a lead UX/UI designer. The goal was to make the platform
more user-friendly and create a coherent user interface.

As I started working on the UI, I had to first and foremost focus on making it
intuitive and coherent, so that the existing clients were able to use the
features that were already build to the platform. This at times felt like
“putting lipstick on a pig”, however with the first iteration of adding the cosmeting touches, we were able to see
the user satisfaction grew, and we could then start revisiting existing and
upcoming features based on feedback we got. The process helped to eliminate
responses that would read “I can’t find the button” and allowed for solving more
to-the-core issues.

## Identity and Branding

Alongside the platform redesign and working on the new, the company needed a new
identity and marketing aids that would allow them to gain new users and help look
professional. The “Collabo Green” was the primary color used for brochures and
on the website. White and breathing space were added to serve a good
understanding of the content.

The problem here I was spreading my attention over many areas. I was
the real full-stack designer at that point and creating the visual identity was
a side task to all the UX/UI changes on they platform. I decided to take an
approach that would be universal to our users, as at that point I was not
able to do extensive market testing and user testing.

I decided to follow the company's vision and mission, and created a logo that would present
the connections between different part of the supply chain.

I was also asked to prepare a physical brochure, both advertising and explaining
how the platform worked. I then also created other materials, like business
cards, stand up roll ups, stickers and other.

The company had to go on pause soon after, and I left to pursuit another challenge. Thanks to the journey with Collabo, I learned a lot about the start-up world and gained confidence and knowledge in various areas of design, but also outside of it.
