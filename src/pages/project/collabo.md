Collabo (earlier Bundl) was a small startup that I joined in 2016. The platform
was a visual collaboration platform for apparel and lifestyle brands and their
suppliers. The SaaS platform covered the whole product cycle from the design to
a finished products' arrival at the company.

## User Interface

I joined Collabo as a lead UX/UI designer. The goal was to make the platform
more user-friendly and create a coherent user interface. Before that, the
company had been working hard on gaining users to support the development of the
solution.

As I started working on the UI, I had to first and foremost focus on making it
intuitive and coherent, so that the existing clients were able to use the
features that were already build to the platform. This at times felt like
“putting lipstick on a pig”, however with the final touches we were able to see
the user satisfaction grew, and we could then start revisiting existing and
upcoming features based on feedback we got. The process helped to eliminate
responses that would read “I can’t find the button” and allowed for solving more
to-the-core issues.

## Identity and Branding

Alongside the platform redesign and working on the new, the company needed a new
identity and marketing aids that would allow them to gain new users and look
professional. The “Collabo Green” was the primary color used for brochures and
on the website. White and breathing space was added to serve a good
understanding of the content.

The problem here was that I had to spread my attention into many areas. I was
the real full-stack designer at that point and creating the visual identity was
a side task to all the UX/UI changes on they platform. I decided to take an easy
approach that would also be universal to our users as at that point I was not
able to do extensive market testing on which approach would be the most
beneficial to take.

I decided to follow vision and mission, and created a logo that would present
the connections between the different part of the supply chain.

I was also asked to prepare a physical brochure, both advertising and explaining
how the platform worked. I then also created other materials, like business
cards, stand up roll ups, stickers and other.
