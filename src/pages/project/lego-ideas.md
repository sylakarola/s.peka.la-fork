LEGO® Ideas is not only a website. It is a popular LEGO® product theme with
hundreds of thousands of LEGO® fans around the world supporting the idea.
Building with LEGO® bricks is a popular hobby to many adults. The company puts a lot of effort to hear them out in the process of creating products and
experiences for the adult audience.

## From Problems to Ideas

Soon after establishing the user [testing setup](./lego-ideas-user-testing) for LEGO® Ideas, we discovered the user group who struggled most were newcomers to the site. Whether a creator or
observer, people missed out on differences between presented submissions.
This resulted in low task success rate and decrease in time spent on the site. Most importantly however, it was obvious to us they were confused. In
order to solve the issue, we decided to create a basic “How it works” page to guide people
who were new to the site. We hoped this would also help the regulars to have a
clear overview of all milestones and recent contents.

## Case Study - How it Works Page

The work started with creating a detailed user journey for newcomers to the
page. We wanted to make sure we didn't exclude any of the jobs to
have done on the site. We used previous research to set up a base for user journeys. At the end we tested the journeys
during user calls to confirm we had the right information about our users.

We learned that the onboarding page helped us internally to guide newcomers find their
starting point on the site. The “How it works” page was constructed to give a
guidance and provide the right CTA so the site could be navigated based on the
intent the user was seeking. Through the process of creating the page,
we used the user testing group to:

- receive feedback on the existing page
- co-created possible solutions of solving the problem as seen from the user perspective and
- test and iterate the prototype and first live designs of the page.

## Case Study - Profile Page

One of the next features we worked on was the profile page. That part of the
website had never been given enough love. It had never been prioritized due to its low visibility compared to other parts of the site. However, during our interviews we discovered it was a go-to place for many users as they often stater their user journey there. The
profile page was a "safe" for all the projects users submitted or sets they
followed to know the current state of things. We decided
to revisit its design. We started with a user test at <abbr title="a yearly event happening in Copenhagen">LEGO World</abbr> where we
presented the existing at that time profile page and asked for feedback. On that
day we collected a lot of information around information architecture and jobs
to be done on and around that page. Next, we sketched scenarios for all user groups,
including newcomers.

To me, the process of designing is never detached from the rest of the internet
world and I have all my respect towards what already exists and what people are
used to. That is why I did a thorough research on various profile and account
pages. Having mapped that, we added our interview information and created a
profile that we believed provided our users

I moved away from the project before we managed to implement the new design and
learn from it through analytics and user interviews. The redesigned page can be currently found
after loggin in on [LEGO® Ideas](https://ideas.lego.com/profile/ebcf1702-1383-4be5-af52-13746e004181/entries?query=&sort=top).
