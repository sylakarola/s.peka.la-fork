LEGO Ideas is not only a website. It is a popular LEGO product theme with
hundreds of thousands of LEGO fans around the world supporting the idea.
Building with LEGO bricks is a popular hobby to many adults and the company puts
in a lot of effort to hear them out in the process of creating products and
experiences for the adult audience.

## From Problems to Ideas

Soon after establishing the user testing setup for LEGO Ideas, we discovered the
primary user group who struggled was newcomers to the site. Whether a creator or
observer, people tented not to see differences between presented submissions.
This resulted in their latter user journey and low task success rate and time
spent on the site, but most importantly to us they seemed genuinely confused. In
order to help we decided on creating a basic “How it works” page to guide people
who were new to the site, but also those who were regulars, so they could have a
clean overview of all milestones and recent contents.

## Case Study - How it Works Page

The work started with creating a detailed user journey for newcomers to the
page. We wanted to make sure we don’t exclude any of the jobs that they came to
have done on the site. We used previous research, as well as tested the journeys
during user calls to confirm we had the right information about our users.

We learned that the page helped us internally to guide newcomers find their
starting point on the site as the “How it works” page constructed to give a
guidance and provide the right CTA so the site could be navigated based on the
job the user was seeking to complete. Through the process of creating the page
we used the previously mentioned user testing group to 1) receive feedback on
the existing page, 2) co-created possible solutions of solving the problem as
seen from the user perspective and 3) test and iterate the prototype and first
live designs of the page.

## Case Study - Profile Page

One of the next features we worked on was the profile page. That part of the
website was never given too much thought as it was simply not as visible as the
feed or project pages. However, during our interviews we discovered it was a go
to place for many users as they often stater their user journey there. The
profile page was a safe for all the projects they submitted or sets they
supported and followed in order to know the current state of things. We decided
to revisit its design. We started with a user test at LEGO World where we
presented the existing at that time profile page and asked for feedback. On that
day we collected a lot of information around information architecture and jobs
to be done around that page. Next, we sketched scenarios for all user groups,
including newcomers.

To me, the process of designing is never detached from the rest of the internet
world and I have all my respect towards what already exists and what people are
used to. That is why I did a thorough research on various profile and account
pages. Having mapped that, we added our interview information and created a
profile that we believed provided our users

I moved away from the project before we managed to implement the new design and
learn from it through analytics and user interviews. The new page can be found
on LEGO Ideas.
