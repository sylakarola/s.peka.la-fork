LEGO® Ideas is a website owned by the LEGO Group. It allows LEGO® fans to create
their own ideas for LEGO® sets. Each project stands a chance to become a real
LEGO® set if it reaches all required milestones within a set time frame. The
collection of ideas that accomplish all stages is then judged by internal judges
at the LEGO Group. The winning sets end up on shelves.

## Everyone Can Become a LEGO® Set Designer

The process of reaching 10.000 votes is complicated. It requires a lot of work
in gathering support from registered users in very limited time. 
<br> Upon joining
the team, I learned that the platform serves various user groups: creators,
supporters, those who interact with projects in any way, as well as casual
viewers. As the user base grew with time, only to reach its peak during
pandemics, the site had to take a natural turn towards revisiting its user
groups and providing a good experience for everyone.

## Establishing User Testing Group

LEGO® Ideas is probably a perfect project for a user experience designer. The
community consists of people who are fans of the brand and are genuinely
interested in providing feedback. In my case, this meant a great deal of
qualitative and quantitative feedback was at the hand’s reach. When I joined the
team, user testing was primarily conducted on physical excursion to LEGO retail
stores, as well as during interviewing a small group of innovators who have
reached the 10.000 votes milestone. We needed a more consistent and structured
way of testing and receiving feedback as we were anticipating a great deal of
new ideas and challenges come our way within next months. Together with the
support of business and a community manager, we decided to use the blog space on
the LEGO®  Ideas website to recruit users for a user test base. Within 2 weeks we
managed to get over 200 people who consented to being contacted for surveys and
user calls. We categorized them based on their persona profile, location,
contribution to the site, and form of participation. This enabled the team to
perform user interview rounds every 2 weeks and send out ad hoc rapid surveys
whenever needed (on average every 1-2 weeks). Having figured out communication
tools to bridge a hermetic corporation setup with the outside world, we created a well functioning user testing setup. That
allowed us to receive feedback in short time from users of different profiles
and from all over the world (even though only approx 70% of contacted users did show up to interviews or
answered our surveys). This also added up to latter
<abbr title="Adult Fans Of Lego">AFOL</abbr> studies that I conducted with
another team in a secret project, that and might soon see some daylight.

## User Groups and Multiple Project Types

Having had the user testing group in place, we started gathering feedback on
existing state of things following our quarterly goals and personas assigned to
them. During our initial interview, we quickly discovered there had been a great
deal of misinterpretation of different types of projects a creator could submit.
On top of well known product ideas,
the site had recently gained two new project types to involve users at all
levels of expertise and engagement in digital product creation.

As we soon learned, this had cast shadow to many features and seemed to be a
topic we had to be investigating constantly and keeping at the back of our heads
while working with all future ideas and features.

This very first UX discovery lead us to creating an onboarding page with easily
digestible information about products and clear
<abbr title="Call To Action">CTA</abbr>s that followed user journeys of the different
personas.
