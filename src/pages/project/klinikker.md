[Klinikker.dk](klinikker.dk) is a Danish search and scheduling platform for
medical care. In 2016 I worked with the Klinikker team on the redesign of the
logo and the company’s identity. The company’s goal was to gain a broad audience
of patients and clinic owners. To do so they needed a reliable visual image and
well functioning platform. In my work I focused on having a coherent visual
image and user experience of their website. I designed visual guidelines
containing color scheme, icons, symbols and other graphic elements to match each
other. The main user experience focus was put on the user flow of the search
engine, simplicity of sign up and accessibility.

## Logo

The old logo contained a symbol of horizontally placed spine, as the Klinikker’s
starting target group were physical therapists. The company asked me to rethink
and propose a new symbol that would be more universal to other medical
professionals that they were going to serve. I started the process of mapping
all the company’s values and trying to establish priorities with the brand.
After several brainstorms we narrowed the list to a few that I played with to
combine in one clear symbol.

The redesign process ended up with a logo that combines company’s values, vision
and mission:

Since the logo turned out to be slightly complex, I added responsiveness to it,
so it could be served big and small, without losing the clarity. The current
version of the website contains the scaled down version.

## Web Design

When I joined, the company had two user types: clinics and patients. The needs
of both had to be addressed differently. When I was entering the project the
problem I had to solve was to optimize the website for the clinics. That part
was especially important due to the fact that clinic owners were the paying
users.

I worked on the presentation of the business value of the premium account,
optimizing the conversion rate of the page. We did several A/B tests in the
process and gathered feedback from users to learn if the site served best for
users.

After I had left Klinikker, the company had experimented with its business model
and decided to change the value proposition and aim at clinics only, providing a
booking service through phone. The website therefore changed.

## User Research and Testing

During the project at Klinikker I worked with the following tools to optimize
user experience of the website:

- A/B testing with Optimizely
- 1-on-1 moderated interviews
- Field research
- Google Analytics
- Screen recording

### Booking Flow

The booking part of the site was an important feature to serve to patients.
Having had several ideas that we internally brainstormed and shortlisted, we
used Optimizely to test which of those would be optimal for the users. Having
done so, we rolled out the following booking flow:

### Sign Up A/B Testing

We also test sign up that would at that point be the crossroad for the two types
of users we served. Based on results we chose one that asked the user to put in
their email and presented two buttons: “I’m a patient” and “I’m a clinic”.

### Contact Flow

One of the company’s mission was to have a well functioning service center to
help those who didn’t have time or skills to rely on online booking. Therefore,
it was important we made contact forms easily accessible on the site. The
following presents way of finding contact information (in orange):
